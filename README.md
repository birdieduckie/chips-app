# Chips App made with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). React dev team argues against using CRA in commercial projects since it's considered to be deprecated. Please check create-next-app template or use your own Webpack + Babel setup.
I show you the list of chips, and you choose whatever chip you like. Choose carefully. 
The goal is to make reusable components and to play with style of course. 
Feel free to star, fork and reuse.
